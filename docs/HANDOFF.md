## Local Machine State
- This file describes a snapshot-bound mainline reality, not the forever-current state of the local machine.
- Local branch, local worktree cleanliness, and local generated artifacts must be checked separately before any new write contour.
- If local worktree is dirty, that does not by itself invalidate this snapshot; it means a hygiene or isolation step is required before new write work.
- If local observation contradicts the snapshot, reconcile local state first and then rebind against current mainline.

## What Is Stable
- Primary editor closure packet exists.
- No input loss suite is green.
- IME composition closure evidence is bound.
- DOCX closure evidence is bound.
- Active bounded product truth is `CAPABILITY_MATRIX.json`, backed by deterministic real-file `GOLDEN_SET_MANIFEST.json`, `IMPORT_EXPORT_ACCEPTANCE.json`, and `REVIEW_BRIDGE_ACCEPTANCE.json`; Phase 06 is delivered, merged, and verified via PR `1083`, feature commit `01b2a5f28fff9c2f3f9451edc1827c0aebf002e7`, and merge SHA `3f71a6fa3b10cecf0973c80a1865552b57e0c180`.
- The old `IMPORT_EXPORT_PRODUCT_ACCEPTANCE_GATE_001_STATUS.json` from PR `1002` is historical and superseded; it is not the current claim authority.
- The current bounded local status is `FEATURE_COMPLETE_V1`: Gate A covers bounded local content import/export and Gate B covers canonical local Review Packet exact Apply with receipt, recovery, and crash reconciliation.
- Mindmap remains derived runtime/status only; no user-facing Mindmap export command is claimed.
- Gate C is delivered, merged, and verified via PR `1085`, feature commit `af7b1897bfe8be726f520680e83437f9a3c2f191`, and merge SHA `72ee480b0fcc53239c162d5302b41a1c87e82dc4` as zero-write DOCX Review comments plus manual tracked text candidates. Gate D, packaged release readiness, full Word layout parity, broad format fidelity, PDF/EPUB/HTML export, cloud, sync, accounts, new dependencies, and user-facing Mindmap export remain unclaimed.
- Current scene TXT export is delivered on current mainline via PR `1060` at merge SHA `c79cb107d3e346df6253b50e9407811449acdd0d`; it originated as a separate post-MVP contour and is now represented by the TXT row in `CAPABILITY_MATRIX.json`.
- `cmd.project.exportCurrentSceneTxtV1` is the bounded user-facing File menu path for exporting the saved current scene only; main owns canonical source read, save dialog resolution, target validation, and atomic external TXT write.
- TXT export source is envelope-parsed canonical current scene content from disk; dirty or unsaved current scene fails closed, non-scene sources fail closed, and the export target cannot equal the current scene path or live inside the project root.
- This current scene TXT export contour does not claim full manuscript TXT export, broader text export, package export, DOCX export change, Markdown export change, Markdown import change, PDF/EPUB/HTML export, release readiness, cross-platform readiness, or Mindmap scope change.
- Selected scenes TXT export is delivered on current mainline via PR `1063` at merge SHA `fd95fba386b31add3373c6179fcef97c2b89afcf`; it originated as a separate post-MVP contour and is now represented by the TXT row in `CAPABILITY_MATRIX.json`.
- `cmd.project.exportSelectedScenesTxtV1` is the bounded user-facing File menu path for exporting canonically selected scenes only; renderer owns only a transient checkbox picker and confirmed sceneIds, while main owns canonical scope rebuild, source reads, save dialog resolution, target validation, and atomic external TXT write.
- The selected-scenes scope query is pathless and project-root-free; tree row selection does not become export truth, persistent multi-select is not introduced, non-scene sources fail closed, and the export target cannot equal any selected scene path or live inside the project root.
- This selected-scenes TXT export contour does not claim full manuscript TXT export, broader text export, package export, persistent tree multi-select, palette command, DOCX export change, Markdown export change, Markdown import change, PDF/EPUB/HTML export, release readiness, cross-platform readiness, or Mindmap scope change.
- All scenes TXT export is delivered on current mainline via PR `1068` at merge SHA `a27bd9757dc94bcb166e349302dbebdab1ce3c07`; it originated as a separate post-MVP contour and is now represented by the TXT row in `CAPABILITY_MATRIX.json`.
- `cmd.project.exportAllScenesTxtV1` is the bounded user-facing File menu path for exporting canonically traversed scene documents only; main reuses the selected-scenes scope builder, owns canonical scene-only scope rebuild, source reads, save dialog resolution, target validation, and atomic external TXT write, while renderer sends only request metadata plus optional outPath.
- The all-scenes scope excludes `chapter-file`, `roman-section`, `materials`, `reference`, `mindmap`, and `print` documents; dirty current scoped scene state fails closed, the export target cannot equal any scoped scene path or live inside the project root, and successful content is joined by one blank line in canonical scene traversal order.
- This all-scenes TXT export contour does not claim full manuscript TXT export, broader text export, package export, chapter assembly semantics, book-profile assembly semantics, palette command, DOCX export change, Markdown export change, Markdown import change, PDF/EPUB/HTML export, release readiness, cross-platform readiness, or Mindmap scope change.
- Current TXT import lane is delivered on current mainline via PR `1061` at merge SHA `cc0f226f68341c649423ba8761b91939cd2dbade`; it originated as a separate post-MVP contour and is now represented by the TXT row in `CAPABILITY_MATRIX.json`.
- `cmd.project.importTxtV1` is the bounded user-facing TXT chooser path on palette and canonical runtime command handling; main owns picker stat read and restat, while `cmd.project.txt.previewLocalFile` and `cmd.project.txt.importSafeCreate` remain bridge-only helpers.
- TXT preview is pathless and write-free; accepted import creates exactly one new scene under `roman/Imported` and opens that created scene on success.
- Accepted TXT encodings are UTF-8 and UTF-8 BOM only; non-UTF8 bytes fail closed, and no DOCX export, DOCX import, Markdown import, Markdown export, or Mindmap claim changes follow from this lane.
- Review bridge controlled multi exact apply is merged on current mainline via PR `1007` at merge SHA `b12ef9178a2e86a3ee758815758bc05dde70f8cc`.
- Review bridge exact-apply lane closeout is bound by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_APPLY_LANE_PRODUCT_CLOSEOUT_REBIND_001_STATUS.json`.
- Review bridge exact-apply lane is closed for current MVP scope only: single exact text apply, duplicate/stale/dirty guards, and controlled same-scene batch exact apply.
- Batch exact apply is all-or-none within one scene file and stays behind command bus, main-owned context, safe writer, recovery evidence, and intent-only renderer payload containing only `requestId` and `changeIds`.
- Local JSON review packet product entry is bound by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_LOCAL_PACKET_PRODUCT_ENTRY_001_STATUS.json`: Review menu exposes Import Review Packet and Clear Review Session, `cmd.project.review.importLocalPacket` owns dialog/read/parse in main, renderer sends only `requestId`, and successful import opens Review/Comments through canonical runtime command handling.
- Local packet intake rejects imported write-evidence fields such as receipts/applied result fields and restats the selected file before read.
- This local packet entry is session/preview wiring only; it does not write manuscript truth and does not authorize apply.
- Local Review Packet export is delivered on current mainline via PR `1070` at merge SHA `a4583bb79e72e5c03b4acd1e1340c80af31a85ca`; `REVIEW_BRIDGE_LOCAL_PACKET_EXPORT_001_STATUS.json` is rebound to `delivered_merged_verified`.
- `cmd.project.review.exportLocalPacket` is a bounded Review menu export path: main reads active `revisionSession.reviewGraph` only, revalidates via `buildRevisionPacketPreview`, resolves the save path in main, writes one external JSON review packet through `writeFileAtomic`, keeps renderer payload authority at requestId only, and leaves `sourceViewState` excluded by default.
- Canonical Review Packet V1 to real Review UI exact apply is delivered on current mainline via PR `1073` at merge SHA `980557a3f52772b2cc3bd1650e45165023659fed`: the real Electron proof covers native packet export, clear-session, native re-import, visible Apply, canonical disk update, editor reload, receipt, readable recovery snapshot, eight zero-write negative branches, and zero network requests.
- Apply crash reconciliation is delivered, merged, and verified via PR `1075`, feature commit `561640947f2488d0c3248d587e925aa7e59d6205`, and merge SHA `314d550199858d055255fa55fc4a457f09c8f495`; durable operationId journals, canonical hashes, verified recovery snapshots, and startup reconciliation distinguish not-applied, applied-without-receipt, and conflict without automatic repeat Apply.
- The existing Review rail shows an operationId-only canonical reload action for user-relevant outcomes; normal single and same-scene batch success force canonical reload, and no renderer path or write authority is added.
- Phase 03 file-authority hardening is delivered, merged, and verified via PR `1077`, feature commit `498c19ca53756280e6ebd70918096c10fc8fe6ee`, and merge SHA `3b5a2f3107f4daf3f9d49ecdbd90488e780e2a4f`: bounded identity-checked reads cover DOCX content, DOCX Review, TXT, Review Packet, and Markdown local files, while one physical target validator covers DOCX, Markdown, TXT, and Review Packet exports with queue-time revalidation.
- Phase 04 Markdown product completion is delivered, merged, and verified via PR `1079`, feature commit `d73c4b943774e0735e7d32835eb82849d1806583`, and merge SHA `ff3ff47757e86c116f8f739804e3ffd2665535f0`: visible palette actions bind the main-owned picker, pathless write-free preview, explicit one-use-token accept, canonical `doc-v2` safe-create, and main-owned Save As.
- Markdown export now reads the canonical saved scene from disk and serializes document IR; it does not reparse plain editor text, it blocks dirty/autosaving/unsaved/non-scene sources, and its true serializer loss report drives a cancel-default main warning before lossy writes.
- Ten deterministic goldens cover literal block markers, code fences and blank lines, lists, Unicode, CRLF, inline marks and links, backtick delimiters, and explicit downgrades. Full CommonMark/GFM and unified capability evidence remain outside Phase 04.
- Phase 05 discoverability and honest labels are delivered, merged, and verified via PR `1081`, feature commit `c8c80775f469c38be40a917955f667348b491767`, and merge SHA `bcfde6816bd340a60a95c6a0c6cd8e738bdca15c`: all supported DOCX, TXT, and Markdown file scenarios are visible in the minimal-profile File menu, while Review Packet Exact Apply is explicitly separated from DOCX Review Evidence with Comments preview and Tracked changes diagnostic limits.
- Native File menu commands open the existing preview and accept UI paths, canonical Markdown commands are the only visible palette entries, and legacy Markdown aliases are internal-only; HTML, CSS, storage, IPC authority, and dependencies are unchanged.
- Current mainline classification: delivered `FEATURE_COMPLETE_V1_PLUS_GATE_C` for Gates A, B, and bounded zero-write Gate C. Word and Google artifact claims, Mindmap export, and project-level cross-scene apply remain separate work.
- Local JSON review packet E2E proof is bound by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_LOCAL_PACKET_E2E_PRODUCT_PROOF_001_STATUS.json`, merged via PR `1011` at merge SHA `a8ea40692afb3c2ef9c30f8152315f13375d3f48`: it proves default main-owned local file intake through the menu command handler, Review/Comments opening, exact single apply after import with receipt and recovery evidence, same-scene batch exact apply after import, mixed structural packet manual-only behavior, and clear-session empty surface.
- This E2E proof changed tests and status docs only; it did not change production runtime code and did not expand import/export MVP scope.
- DOCX review preflight is delivered and merged via PR `1013` at merge SHA `34895b960a723b816ccb7f50f171854675a43969`; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_DOCX_PREFLIGHT_001_STATUS.json`.
- `cmd.project.review.inspectDocxReviewPreflight` produces a pathless diagnostic-only report for DOCX comments and tracked-change markers without creating a Review session, apply operation, receipt, recovery, or project write.
- DOCX review preflight is Review Bridge work, not an expansion of the closed import/export MVP scope; it does not route through `cmd.project.importDocxV1` or safe-create.
- DOCX review preview session activation is delivered and merged via PR `1014` at merge SHA `c608541f93688150ddc3d0dee08b33dfaab01e5f`; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_DOCX_PREVIEW_SESSION_ACTIVATION_001_STATUS.json`.
- `cmd.project.review.activateDocxReviewPreviewSession` accepts pathless DOCX bytes, converts DOCX comments into bounded Review Packet comment threads, activates an in-memory Stage01 preview Review session, and opens Review/Comments on success.
- DOCX review preview session activation converts bounded adjacent deletion-plus-insertion replacements and standalone insertions or deletions into manual TextChange candidates; moves, tables, nested revisions, and ambiguous structure remain manual structural review. Comment placements remain manual, main owns project, file, and baseline context, and preview creates no manuscript write, project write, receipt, or recovery evidence.
- DOCX review local-file entry is delivered and merged via PR `1015` at merge SHA `824d96b739bdbd8b7a45b1bf1664b003a2a65fd2`; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_DOCX_REVIEW_LOCAL_FILE_ENTRY_001_STATUS.json`.
- DOCX comments-only review preview product proof is delivered and merged via PR `1016` at merge SHA `80706d1205049d071b1737634dc41cd9125e26d8`; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_DOCX_COMMENT_ONLY_PRODUCT_PROOF_001_STATUS.json`.
- The proof covers the current DOCX comments-only review preview path: Review menu exposes `cmd.project.review.openDocxReviewPreviewSession`, main owns DOCX picker/stat/read/restat, selected DOCX comments reach the in-memory Review surface as commentThreads plus manual commentPlacements, and successful activation opens Review/Comments through the canonical runtime command path.
- DOCX comments-only review preview is separate from DOCX import preview and safe-create; it does not create textChanges from tracked changes, applyOps, manuscript truth writes, project truth writes, receipt, or recovery evidence.
- DOCX diagnostic evidence surface contour is delivered and merged via PR `1020` at merge SHA `02754b5f6ac6bd231b6d47659453ab92ddd6d979`; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_DOCX_DIAGNOSTIC_EVIDENCE_SURFACE_001_STATUS.json`.
- Tracked-changes-only DOCX now opens a visible diagnostic-only Review surface as read-only diagnosticItems while keeping `canOpenReviewSession`, `canCreateReviewPacket`, `canAutoApply`, `canImportMutate`, and `canWriteStorage` false; clean DOCX with no evidence remains no-candidate/passive.
- The diagnostic evidence surface remains Review Bridge visibility only: no DOCX import safe-create route, no textChanges, no applyOps, no manuscript/project truth write, no receipt, and no recovery.
- Review Bridge first useful release gate is delivered and merged via PR `1018` at merge SHA `d76485d152c1bfa1cb00bf9eda0c242596785352`; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_FIRST_USEFUL_RELEASE_GATE_001_STATUS.json` as a bounded feature gate only: local JSON review packet import to Review surface plus one exact text safe apply with receipt and recovery evidence, with DOCX comments-only preview as a separate manual preview surface.
- This gate rebinds `REVIEW_BRIDGE_APPLY_LANE_PRODUCT_CLOSEOUT_REBIND_001_STATUS.json` from stale pending-delivery wording to delivered mainline truth for PR `1008` at merge SHA `5acc7612f109153820e71ed3f474f211be213601`.
- Review Bridge first useful release truth repair is delivered and merged via PR `1066` at merge SHA `d24e4bd1cda4e051c06df614964552c3c634afc7`; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_FIRST_USEFUL_RELEASE_TRUTH_REPAIR_001_STATUS.json`, removes public `cmd.project.review.importPacket` from the UI command bridge and public menu handlers, keeps `cmd.project.review.importLocalPacket` as the only public local JSON packet intake path, and keeps `handleReviewSurfaceImportPacketCommandSurface` internal to main-owned session normalization and DOCX preview reuse.
- Current gate proof now fails closed by rerunning the live Review Bridge smoke contracts for local packet import, DOCX review preview session, and DOCX review local-file entry; the affected VM harnesses explicitly inject computed menu command ids so computed-key extraction cannot false-red the gate.
- This truth repair does not widen Review Bridge scope: no new review import automation, no new apply authority, no DOCX apply, no safe-create change, no import/export MVP widening, no release readiness, and no Y9 claim follow from it.
- The gate does not claim release readiness, packaged readiness, cross-platform readiness, full review import automation, full DOCX review import, exact apply from DOCX, structural apply, comment auto-apply, cross-scene atomicity, multi-file transaction truth, or import/export MVP scope expansion.
- Review bridge exact-apply lane closeout does not claim cross-scene batch atomicity, multi-file transaction truth, structural auto-apply, comment auto-apply, full review import automation, full import/export completion beyond the existing MVP closeout, full Word layout parity, PDF/EPUB/HTML export, user-facing Mindmap export command, release readiness, or Y9 admission.
- DOCX review preflight command itself does not claim review packet activation or automatic Review session opening; activation is owned by the separate preview-session contour.
- DOCX review preview session activation does not claim full DOCX review import, tracked-change apply, exact apply, structural apply, comment auto-apply, receipt or recovery creation, Word layout parity, or broad DOCX fidelity.
- Word evidence claim binding contour is delivered and merged; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_WORD_EVIDENCE_CLAIM_BINDING_001_STATUS.json`.
- The contour product-binds the existing `CONTOUR_10_WORD_EVIDENCE_CHECK_R2` gate: a Word evidence claim can pass only with a valid packet, matching evidence hash, and coverage not wider than packet coverage.
- This is not Word support: no Word support, Word import, Word roundtrip, Word layout parity, full DOCX fidelity, apply, project truth write, receipt, recovery, DOCX safe-create change, DOCX export change, or import/export MVP widening is claimed.
- Google Docs evidence claim binding contour is delivered and merged; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_GOOGLE_DOCS_EVIDENCE_CLAIM_BINDING_001_STATUS.json`.
- The contour product-binds the existing `CONTOUR_11_GOOGLE_DOCS_EVIDENCE_CHECK` gate: a Google Docs evidence claim can pass only with a valid packet, matching evidence hash, coverage not wider than packet coverage, and both docsSuggestions and driveComments coverage.
- This is not Google Docs support: no Google Docs support, Google Docs import, Google Docs sync, Google Docs roundtrip, Google Docs layout parity, full Google Docs fidelity, Google API integration, network access, apply, project truth write, receipt, recovery, DOCX safe-create change, DOCX export change, or import/export MVP widening is claimed.
- Format matrix claim binding contour is delivered and merged; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_FORMAT_MATRIX_CLAIM_BINDING_001_STATUS.json`.
- The contour product-binds the existing `CONTOUR_12_FORMAT_MATRIX_CLAIM_GATE`: a format matrix claim can pass only with a valid matrix, valid golden set, matching row, matching formatId and surface, matching golden set hash, complete requiredTests, and claimScope within the selected row surface.
- This is not format support: no new user-facing format support, import support, export support, roundtrip, layout parity, full fidelity, release claim dossier acceptance, release readiness, apply, project truth write, receipt, recovery, DOCX safe-create change, DOCX export change, or import/export MVP widening is claimed.
- Release claim dossier binding contour is delivered and merged via PR `1028` at merge SHA `06ca9d07c03fc095dda683e2a0f2c79e068c7f91`; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_RELEASE_CLAIM_DOSSIER_BINDING_001_STATUS.json`.
- The contour product-binds the existing `CONTOUR_12B_RELEASE_CLAIM_DOSSIER_GATE`: dossier gate acceptance requires valid schema, non-empty items, unique itemId values, valid matrix/golden-set/claim rows, matching hashes, complete requiredTests, and claimScope within row surface.
- This is not release readiness: no release readiness, user-facing release, release admission completion, release execution completion, release publication completion, Word support, Google Docs support, import support, export support, roundtrip, layout parity, full fidelity, apply, project truth write, receipt, recovery, DOCX safe-create change, DOCX export change, or import/export MVP widening is claimed.
- Release claim admission binding contour is delivered, merged, and verified; it is tracked by `REVIEW_BRIDGE_RELEASE_CLAIM_ADMISSION_BINDING_001_STATUS.json`.
- The contour product-binds and hardens the existing `CONTOUR_12C_RELEASE_CLAIM_ADMISSION_GATE`: admission requires accepted 12B dossier provenance, claimScope covered by accepted 12B item evaluations, required claim classes, and no baseline debt; caller-supplied coveredScope cannot widen admission coverage.
- This is not release readiness: no release readiness, user-facing release, release mode decision completion, release execution completion, release publication completion, Word support, Google Docs support, import support, export support, roundtrip, layout parity, full fidelity, apply, project truth write, receipt, recovery, DOCX safe-create change, DOCX export change, or import/export MVP widening is claimed.

- The wrong launch came from local branch/head `a670f276759889ce90d1aa535ac7c84746b9f470` and it is not authority.
- The repeated launch and owner confirmation were on main head `b101939f03996479e90441b1d0cd8ffb4d110e0f`.
- Prep frame `YALKEN_DESIGN_OS_PREP_AND_SELECTION_FRAME_V7` is archival only.
- Repo-wide done is confirmed on main after merge gate and post-merge reconfirm.
- shell safe-reset and restore proof closure contour is merged on current mainline.

- architecture posture `ARCH-0001` is closed on current mainline for current scope A after static evidence rebind confirmed no runtime-impacting circular or unresolved break.
- current scope A is symbolic closeout ready on current mainline.
- blocked lanes remain explicit blocked debt; later items remain explicit later or hold debt.
- security audit lane is standardized on repo mainline via generic semgrep runner and package script; generic scan is repeatable with zero findings and honest timeout reporting.
- test electron lane is ready and executed on current mainline with repeated pass runs.
- X102 Block 01 visual reproof completed report-only against the selected-base snapshot at the time of X102 reproof and ended with STOP_AND_FREEZE.
- No new live nonblocked Group 01 visual delta was proved by that reproof.
- Design write lane remains closed after the latest X102 reproof.
- vertical sheets historical baseline merge point on main history is `4c4eca3aba79c7d689d39b822f689f8939ca58ce`; the current viewport-continuity repair contour preserves the one TipTap/ProseMirror source, derived visual sheet stack, view-only gaps, and no page truth invariant.
- current mainline head includes C05 long-document performance closeout at `792f28077973721669aef9cf78d9385b1fb1db29` from contour source commit `58a2aced76bb914b3128024ad75588f789b24b28`.
- current viewport repair evidence is green for `five-sheet-visible-smoke`, `vertical-sheet-gap-smoke`, `vertical-sheet-feed-smoke`, `vertical-sheet-input-stability-smoke`, `derived-sheet-classification-smoke`, `boundary-enter-flow-smoke`, `boundary-selection-replace-smoke`, `editorial-sheet-fast-scroll-catchup-smoke`, `editorial-sheet-zoom50-boundary-leak-smoke`, and `editorial-sheet-visible-page-text-coverage-smoke` at 2000 and 10000 targets.
- the repair also reran `editor-sheet-instrumented-stress-smoke` at target 10000 and observed actual 11495 pages, 7 rendered sheet shells, stable text hash, zero network requests, zero dialog calls, and physical bottom proof including the final page.
- the scroll/zoom performance follow-up keeps large-payload pagination on estimated text length, collapses the hidden ProseMirror paint/layout surface, and leaves the visible text on derived sheet shells; the 10000 visible coverage smoke carries scroll/zoom perf proof with max scroll step about 50ms and max zoom step about 80ms on the recorded local run.
- the follow-up 10000 stress run observed actual 12124 pages, 8 rendered sheet shells, stable text hash, typing undo/redo cleanup restored, zero network requests, zero dialog calls, and physical bottom proof including the final page.
- the line-clip repair contour keeps the large-payload visible layer derived-only but renders bounded line-safe runtime rows instead of one overflowing text node; `editorial-sheet-visible-page-text-coverage-smoke` now hard-fails on content-boundary text boxes, forbidden margin ink, and boundary ink leaks. Two serial 10000 visible coverage reruns observed total page count 31479, 9 boundary frame pairs, zero empty significant pages, zero empty paint pages, zero content-boundary pages, zero forbidden margin ink pages, zero boundary ink leaks, max scroll step about 68ms, and max zoom step about 86ms on the slower recorded run.
- the line-clip repair 10000 stress run observed actual 12124 pages, 8 rendered sheet shells, stable text hash, typing undo/redo cleanup restored, zero network requests, zero dialog calls, and physical bottom proof including the final page.
- `VERTICAL_SHEET_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE_RUN_001` is report-only baseline evidence for 10, 50, and 100 page scenarios; it is not a hard performance gate and not a repo-persisted artifact.
- vertical acceptance does not close production release readiness, cross-platform readiness, full Word-like pagination, export parity, tables/cards/media pagination, horizontal multi-page overview, above-10000 readiness, or toolbar test tails.
- toolbar configuration subsystem is rebaselined to current repo truth:
  - `LIVE_COUNT = 17`
  - `PLANNED_IDS = []`
  - `BLOCKED_IDS = [toolbar.insert.image, toolbar.proofing.spellcheck, toolbar.proofing.grammar]`
  - blocked reasons are explicit and catalog-bound
  - `master` profile is visible in configurator flow
  - ordering runtime is realized
  - old Wave C literal text is superseded; truthful closure is `Wave C1 + blocked decisions`
- toolbar contour `TOOLBAR_METRIC_SHELL_DESCALE_002` is merged on main from commit `8e41f0600fccabb43abd773aee40aa5ccb9628f5` via PR `749`
- toolbar contour `TOOLBAR_NATIVE_FLUENCY_VISUAL_REFINE_001` is merged on main from commit `59c398d8ba02390fff5dc0a435f26d1f142fbb7a` via PR `750`
- the earlier whole-shell descale is superseded by owner-approved contour `TOOLBAR_UNIFORM_SCALE_RESTORE_001`: the main formatting toolbar again has independent 0.5x–2.0x uniform scale in both orientations
- contour `TOOLBAR_METRIC_SCALE_SHARPNESS_001` supersedes layout zoom with DPR-snapped real metrics for the main toolbar body
- contour `TOOLBAR_NATIVE_FLUENCY_OPTICAL_SHARPNESS_002` adds orientation-aware body projection and slower optical-rhythm growth so the persisted 0.5x–2.0x state remains useful without producing an oversized soft toolbar
- contour `TOOLBAR_QUIET_CONTRAST_REBALANCE_003` returns light-theme chrome to the prior quiet opacity after owner review; DPR-snapped metrics, zero letter spacing and optical scale projection remain unchanged
- width-scale stays independent; popup menus, transform handles, the editor sheet and the left system toolbar remain outside the metric scale layer
- native fluency toolbar contract remains reconfirmed: no transform-scale or blur trick in toolbar shell sections
- required checks for both merged toolbar contours passed: `oss-policy`, `x1-runtime-parity (ubuntu-latest)`, `x1-runtime-parity (windows-latest)`
- committed editorial sheet 10000 stress evidence is held in `EDITORIAL_SHEET_STRESS_LANE_STATUS_V3.json`, generated by `CONTOUR_04_WRITE_IMPL`; the authoritative execution binding is the artifact's `repo.headSha`.
- tracked 10000 scale proof in that committed artifact observed actual 11510 pages, 7 rendered sheet shells, 1132 DOM nodes, stable text hash, zero network requests, zero dialog calls, and physical bottom proof where rendered sheet numbers 11504-11510 include the final page 11510.
- tracked acceptance rows 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 10000 pass; diagnostic rows `VIEWPORT_CONTINUITY`, `INPUT_CONTINUITY`, and `GAP_CONTINUITY` also pass but remain diagnostic-only.
- operator report `CONTOUR_05_FINAL_NO_REGRESSION_GATE_RETRY_V4` is not a committed proof artifact in this tree and must not be treated as executable repo proof by itself.
- `EDITORIAL_SHEET_5000_CLOSEOUT_SUMMARY.json` is a non-authoritative navigation summary; active canon and executed proof artifacts remain higher authority.
- above-10000 scale, production release, cross-platform release, and manual design approval remain unclaimed by this rebind.

## What Is Next
1. keep Y8 cutover truth and rollback truth as one active factual reality
2. do not reinterpret Y8 as automatic Y9 authority
3. if no new live nonblocked contradiction is reproved, preserve current mainline closure truth
4. current no-contradiction state should remain symbolic closeout ready with blocked or later freeze
5. if a new live nonblocked contradiction is reproved, open one explicit evidence-backed contour selection brief only
6. after vertical sheets factual sync, select exactly one next contour; do not open automatic runtime, export, toolbar, perf, or docs work by implication
7. after editorial sheet 10000 stress rebind, viewport-continuity repair, and import/export MVP-scope closeout, select exactly one next contour; eligible future lanes include above-10000 resource profiling, manual macOS design gate, post-MVP export expansion, platform adapters, collaboration, comments, or history, but none opens by implication.
8. Review Bridge contour `REVIEW_BRIDGE_RELEASE_CLAIM_MODE_DECISION_BINDING_001` is delivered, merged, and verified via PR `1032`, merge SHA `a48039cd7c79f9bc00e37b427436999ab9f47b78`.
9. The active contour is a release claim mode decision binding contour, not a release readiness contour.
10. This contour product-binds `CONTOUR_12D_RELEASE_CLAIM_MODE_DECISION_GATE`: accepted 12D requires accepted 12B dossier provenance and accepted 12C admission provenance, and derives claimId, dossierId, and matrixId from accepted upstream provenance.
11. Immediate downstream 12E and 12F were hardened only to reject forged accepted 12D or 12E envelopes by re-evaluating raw upstream payloads.
12. Scope truth for this contour: not release readiness; no release readiness, user-facing release, attestation completion, packet emit completion, release execution completion, release publication completion, Word support, Google Docs support, import support, export support, roundtrip, layout parity, full fidelity, apply, project truth write, receipt, recovery, DOCX safe-create change, DOCX export change, import/export MVP widening, or Y9 is claimed.
13. Review Bridge contour `REVIEW_BRIDGE_RELEASE_CLAIM_ATTESTATION_BINDING_001` is delivered, merged, and verified via PR `1034`, merge SHA `4d8e0a1b2eb065913bdc018304106c1f7e0973f1`.
14. The active contour is a release claim attestation binding contour, not a release readiness contour.
15. This contour product-binds `CONTOUR_12E_RELEASE_CLAIM_ATTESTATION_GATE`: accepted 12E requires accepted 12D provenance, raw 12D re-evaluation, matching recomputed 12D envelope, matching decisionHash, matching commandRunDigest, matching evidenceHash, and RELEASE_MODE release evidence fields.
16. RELEASE_MODE 12E releaseEvidenceId and releaseEvidenceHash now must match accepted 12D release evidence.
17. Immediate downstream 12F was hardened only as a direct guard: it blocks mixed accepted 12D and 12E pairs when 12E decisionHash does not match the top-level accepted 12D result.
18. Scope truth for this contour: not release readiness; no release readiness, user-facing release, packet emit completion, release execution completion, release publication completion, Word support, Google Docs support, import support, export support, roundtrip, layout parity, full fidelity, apply, project truth write, receipt, recovery, DOCX safe-create change, DOCX export change, import/export MVP widening, or Y9 is claimed.

20. The active contour is a release claim packet emit binding contour, not a release readiness contour.
21. This contour product-binds `CONTOUR_12F_RELEASE_CLAIM_PACKET_EMIT`: accepted 12F requires own canonical packetMeta, accepted 12D provenance, accepted 12E provenance, raw 12D and raw 12E re-evaluation, and matching mode, claimId, dossierId, matrixId, and decisionHash bindings.
22. 12F now strips inherited prototype fields before acceptance checks, blocking inherited packetMeta, inherited accepted 12D envelopes, inherited accepted 12E envelopes, and inherited RELEASE_MODE `USER_FACING_CLAIM_READY` packet paths.
23. `USER_FACING_CLAIM_READY` remains an internal packet/report modeClass only; it is not release readiness, not user-facing release, not release execution, and not release publication.
24. Scope truth for this contour: not release readiness; no release readiness, user-facing release, release execution completion, release publication completion, Word support, Google Docs support, import support, export support, roundtrip, layout parity, full fidelity, apply, project truth write, receipt, recovery, DOCX safe-create change, DOCX export change, import/export MVP widening, or Y9 is claimed.
25. Review Bridge contour `REVIEW_BRIDGE_RELEASE_CLAIM_USER_FACING_BOUNDARY_BINDING_001` is delivered, merged, and verified via PR `1038`, merge SHA `a94d19671aede4a12ed4b38310bfb4de5368efaf`, and feature commit `1974f0ad6a35537e1355e8b423b30745ce4d31f9` as the bounded next contour after delivered release claim packet emit binding.
26. The active contour is a release claim user-facing boundary binding contour, not a release readiness contour.
27. This contour product-binds `CONTOUR_12G_RELEASE_CLAIM_USER_FACING_BOUNDARY_GATE`: accepted 12G requires accepted 12F packet emit provenance, raw packet emit binding fields for mode, claimId, dossierId, matrixId, releaseClass, packetId, and attestationId, matching packet/report/binding fields for mode, claimId, dossierId, matrixId, and releaseClass, packet/report/summary packetHash linkage to a recomputed release claim packet hash, and packetId plus attestationId linkage across packet emit binding, packet, and strict report.
28. `PR_MODE` plus `USER_FACING` boundary surface is blocked; `RELEASE_MODE` plus `USER_FACING` is accepted only as boundary admission when the accepted 12F packet class is `USER_FACING_CLAIM_READY`.
29. 12G now strips inherited prototype fields before boundary input and packetEmitResult acceptance checks, blocking inherited boundary input, inherited accepted packet emit results, and inherited nested packet provenance.
30. `USER_FACING` is a boundary surface in this contour only; it is not release readiness, not a user-facing release, not a user-facing UI state, not release execution, and not release publication.
31. Scope truth for this contour: not release readiness; no release readiness, user-facing release, release execution completion, release publication completion, publication authority, command admission, kernel fence, Word support, Google Docs support, import support, export support, roundtrip, layout parity, full fidelity, apply, project truth write, receipt, recovery, DOCX safe-create change, DOCX export change, import/export MVP widening, or Y9 is claimed.

33. The active contour is a release claim publication gate binding contour, not product publication, not release readiness, and not a user-facing release contour.
34. This contour product-binds `CONTOUR_12H_RELEASE_CLAIM_PUBLICATION_GATE`: accepted 12H requires raw 12G boundary input, re-evaluates 12G internally, and requires the internally accepted 12G result to carry mode, claimId, dossierId, matrixId, releaseClass, claimSurface, packetId, and attestationId.
35. Optional boundaryResult is consistency evidence only; stale or fabricated boundaryResult values are blocked unless they match the internally re-evaluated 12G result.
36. `PR_MODE` plus `USER_FACING` publication gate requests are blocked through the 12G boundary gate chain; `RELEASE_MODE` plus `USER_FACING` is accepted only as internal publication gate admission when the accepted 12G boundary releaseClass is `USER_FACING_CLAIM_READY`.

39. The active contour is a release claim kernel fence binding contour, not command availability, not command admission, not command execution, not product publication, not release readiness, and not a user-facing release contour.
40. This contour product-binds `CONTOUR_12I_RELEASE_CLAIM_KERNEL_FENCE`: accepted 12I requires raw 12H publication input, re-evaluates 12H internally, and requires the internally accepted 12H result to carry mode, claimId, dossierId, matrixId, releaseClass, claimSurface, packetId, and attestationId.
41. Optional publicationResult is consistency evidence only; stale, fabricated, inherited, or non-plain publicationResult values are blocked unless they match the internally re-evaluated 12H result.

48. commandId is command admission evidence identity only, not command execution.
49. `PR_MODE` plus `USER_FACING` command admission requests are blocked through the 12I kernel fence chain; `RELEASE_MODE` plus `USER_FACING` is accepted only as internal command admission evidence when the accepted 12I kernel fence releaseClass is `USER_FACING_CLAIM_READY`.

58. The active contour is a release claim command surface admission binding contour, not command availability, not command execution, not release execution completion, not product publication, not release readiness, and not a user-facing release contour.
59. This contour product-binds `CONTOUR_12L_COMMAND_SURFACE_RELEASE_CLAIM_ADMISSION`: accepted 12L requires `cmd.project.releaseClaim.admit` on the command surface kernel allowlist, `command.bus` dispatch, blocked direct route bypass, and blocked non-allowlisted command ids.
60. Accepted 12L calls the already-bound 12K execution gate and returns its result as admission-only evidence.
61. 12L rejects non-plain or inherited top-level payload objects before invoking the 12K execution gate.
62.

66. Accepted 12M calls the already-bound 12K execution gate and wraps the accepted, diagnostics, or blocked upstream result into a typed witness-only envelope with `witnessOnly: true`.
67. 12M rejects non-plain or inherited top-level payload objects before invoking the 12K execution gate; the command surface kernel preserves typed witness envelopes only for the bounded release-claim command surface ids instead of widening passthrough to unrelated command ids.
68. At the real `ui:command-bridge` boundary, accepted 12M returns as outer `ok: true` with `value`, while diagnostics or blocked witness output stays preserved under the outer command bridge failure envelope `value`.
69.

71. This contour is a release claim command surface trigger witness binding contour, not command availability, not command execution, not release execution completion, not runtime queue semantics, not product publication, not release readiness, and not a user-facing release contour.
72. This contour product-binds `CONTOUR_12N_RELEASE_CLAIM_COMMAND_SURFACE_TRIGGER_WITNESS`: accepted 12N keeps `cmd.project.releaseClaim.execute` on the command surface kernel allowlist, keeps `command.bus` dispatch, keeps blocked direct route bypass and blocked non-allowlisted command ids, and keeps `summary.witnessOnly: true`.
73. Accepted 12N writes exactly one deterministic in-memory trigger witness record keyed by `packetId` only when the bounded 12M witness result is accepted.
74. The trigger witness registry lifetime is the current main-process lifetime only; it is not replayed from storage and does not become project truth.
75. Accepted 12N blocks missing `packetId` before any trigger witness record is written and blocks a second trigger witness write for an already-recorded `packetId` with a deterministic duplicate-packet blocked witness outcome.
76. Diagnostics or blocked 12M witness output writes no trigger witness record, and the real `ui:command-bridge` outer accepted versus failure envelope semantics remain unchanged.

80. This contour product-binds `CONTOUR_12O_RELEASE_CLAIM_REAL_EXECUTION_EPHEMERAL_EFFECT`: accepted 12O keeps `cmd.project.releaseClaim.execute` on the command surface kernel allowlist, keeps `command.bus` dispatch, keeps blocked direct route bypass and blocked non-allowlisted command ids, and evaluates the already-bound 12K execution gate directly from raw command input before any effect write.
81. Accepted 12O emits a typed real execution effect result with `summary.ephemeralEffectOnly: true`, with no `summary.witnessOnly` field, and writes exactly one deterministic in-memory execution effect record keyed by `packetId` only when the bounded 12K result is accepted.

90. Accepted 12P emits a typed publication effect result with `summary.publicationEffectOnly: true`, with no `summary.witnessOnly` field and no `summary.ephemeralEffectOnly` field, and writes exactly one deterministic in-memory publication effect record keyed by `packetId` only when the bounded 12O result is accepted.
91. The publication effect registry lifetime is the current main-process lifetime only; it is not replayed from storage and does not become project truth.
92. Accepted 12P blocks missing `packetId` before any publication effect record is written and blocks a second publication effect write for an already-recorded `packetId` with a deterministic duplicate-packet blocked publication-effect outcome.

## Working Agreement
- Bounded contours only
- No false-green
- No stale-green
- No split-brain docs
- Write contour should not advance without commit outcome

## Active Mode
- Orchestrator mode active.
- Code writing delegated to separate code agent.
- Zero-tail policy active.

## UI Reading Note
- For UI tasks, system constraints stay in repo canon.
- For Design OS change work, use `docs/YALKEN_DESIGN_OS_CHANGE_GUIDE_V2_2.md` as the advisory operating guide.
- Visual snapshots are temporary iteration references, not permanent design law.

## Current Risk Boundary
- Do not treat post-version-one evaluation as automatic new release scope.
- Do not skip rollback packet when formal cutover is claimed.
- Do not imply Y9 or release hardening by narrative-only text.
